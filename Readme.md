# NanosCrypt Programming Language

NanosCrypt is a revolutionary programming language designed for flexibility, simplicity, and security. With NanosCrypt, you have the freedom to code the way you prefer, whether it's using semicolons or not, or choosing between indentation or curly braces. It provides an elegant and straightforward syntax for input and output, making coding a breeze. Our ongoing goal is to create a language with predefined data structures for every purpose, making it a powerful tool for developers.

## Features

- **Flexibility**: Choose your coding style; use semicolons or not, and switch between indentation or curly braces.
- **Simplicity**: Streamlined input and output syntax, even simpler than Python.
- **Security**: Efforts to make NanosCrypt secure against most reverse engineering techniques.
- **Predefined Data Structures** (Future Goal): We're working towards providing predefined data structures for all your programming needs.

## Getting Started

To use NanosCrypt, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `NanosCrypt.py` file and your NanosCrypt source code (e.g., `filename.nc`).

3. Run your NanosCrypt code using the following command:

```bash
python NanosCrypt.py filename.nc
```
## Sample File

We've included a sample file, `input.nc`, to help you get started and experiment with NanosCrypt's features.
